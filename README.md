# Marshall Wace UI Developer technical test

## Next steps

Congratulations! You've completed the test.

If you have any feedback on the test itself that you would like the dev team to see (or if you feel there is anything you need to explain about your solution), make sure to save that in [FEEDBACK.md](./FEEDBACK.md) before proceeding. This is totally optional, so feel free to leave this file blank.

You can submit your test solution as follows:

1. Run `npm pack` within the project directory. This will create a file named `mw-ui-challenge-v1.0.0.tgz` that includes the contents of the `src` and `public` folders.

2. Upload the resulting `mw-ui-challenge-v1.0.0.tgz` file to the link contained in the email you received.

Thanks for taking part, and make sure to let us know if there's anything that we can improve!
